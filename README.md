### :wave: Hello! I'm **Stefano**

I am an italian software developer based in Milan. I strongly believe in good practices and team working. </br>
I always try to apply some magic tricks which will transform bad code into clean code.<br/>

I am passionate about every music genre and in my free time I like being a self-taught guitar player. I also like photography and whenever I can, I go for a hike in the nature with my camera.
