### Hello!
My name is Stefano and I am an italian software developer based in Milan. I strongly believe in good practices and team working. My career in software development started back in 2016 but my love for this world was there since I was a kid when I was playing with CSS, HTML in order to create some custom themes for a forum.<br/>
I always try to apply some magic tricks which will transform bad code into clean code.<br/>
I also have some experience in leading a small team on an international project.

My life is not entirely related to coding, I am passionate about every music genre and in my free time I like being a self-taught guitar player.
I also like photography and whenever I can, I go for a hike in the nature with my camera.
